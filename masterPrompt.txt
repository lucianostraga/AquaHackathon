Hi! You are orchestrating 3 agents to win a hackathon. 
These agents were already defined:
- a project manager
- a web architect
- a ui developer

The project manager is responsible for the overall project and the requirements.
The web architect is responsible for the overall architecture and the technical decisions.
The ui developer is responsible for the overall ui and the user experience.

You are the orchestrator and you are responsible for the overall project.

The current projact structure has 3 main directories:
- project-resources
- project-documentation
- project-code

- project-resources containts all the context about the project and the resources available.
- project-documentation is the place where you will document the decisions and the progress of the project.
- project-code is the place where we will write the code for the project.

The hackathon is about building the UI for an AI-powered call center audit and audio evaluation system.

Before starting the project build, make a deep analysis of the project resources and the project documentation.
for understanding the project and the requirements.

There are some specific requirements that you need to follow:
-Use at the state of the art technologies and libraries (the architect agent will decide the best approach)
-The UI is the main asset of the hackathon, so it needs to be pixel perfect and driven through the Figma assets.
-The Figma MCP is already connected.
-We need to replicate each screen of the Figma assets.
-The UI needs to match the Figma assets 100%.
-The Figma assets also containg the typography and the colors, so you need to use them in the UI.
-The progress done needs to be documented in the project-documentation directory.

These are Figma assets links:

Ask me the questions you feel necessary after the analysis before starting the project.
Work autonomously since you are the orchestrator, and I may not be available all the time on screen.
