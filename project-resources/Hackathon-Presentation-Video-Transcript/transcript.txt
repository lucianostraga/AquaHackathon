All right, innovators, [music] welcome.
Let's talk about your next big
challenge, the Aqua Hackathon. So,
here's what we're going to cover.
[music] The problem, our solution, Aqua,
and of course, your mission. Think about
call centers. Quality is [music]
everything, right? But checking in is
super slow and manual. Right now,
[music] people listen to a tiny fraction
of calls. It's basically guesswork
hoping to find something. And that's
where [music] Aqua comes in. It's all
about quality, speed, and automation for
everything. Aqua checks every single
call 100% so you get the full picture on
[music] quality. And the workflow is
super simple. You upload, the AI
analyzes, you review, then you coach.
You literally just drop [music] the
audio files in. By the time you grab
coffee, it's done. And boom, [music]
every call is right here. The good, the
bad. No more hunting around for info.
Aqua pinpoints the exact moments that
matter. [music] A missed greeting, a
compliance risk, you name it. So
reviewers can drop in precise timestamps
[music] notes. No more long reports,
just quick feedback.
So the back end is all set. It's
powerful, but it needs an [music]
amazing interface. That's you. Your
mission, build the entire front end and
BFF to bring the Aqua experience to
life. But don't worry, [music] you're
not starting from scratch. We're giving
you everything you need to start. All
right, get those calendars out. The main
hackathon is 10 days starting November
28th. Look, we've handled the back end.
Your job is [music] 100% focused on that
user experience. Okay, so how do you
actually win this thing? Let's break
down the judging. It's a simple 100point
system. 50/50 split between your app and
[music] your AI tool usage. For the app,
we want to see it working, well-built,
and something with that wow factor. For
the AI part, show [music] us how it made
you faster and what cool stuff you
learned. And yeah, there are prizes.
We've got three big cash awards up for
grabs. And that grand [music] prize for
first place, a cool 4,000 bucks. Not
bad, right? So, make it [music] fast,
slick, and unforgettable. This is your
chance to shine. Let's [music] get
building.
